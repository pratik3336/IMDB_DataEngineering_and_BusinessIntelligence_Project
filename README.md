# IMDB_DataEngineering_and_BusinessIntelligence_Project

## Project Overview

### Objective
This project focuses on analyzing movie data from a variety of sources including IMDb, MoviesLens, The Numbers, and BoxOffice Mojo. Our goal is to explore aspects such as movie casts, box office revenues, movie brands, and franchises. We employ ETL processes using tools like Talend and Alteryx to manage and transform the data effectively.

### Description
The architecture of this project is based on a Multi-Star schema design comprising 10 Fact tables and 33 Dimension tables. We developed a comprehensive Data Integration Pipeline using Talend to manage over 380 million rows of data sourced from various formats including CSV, MySQL, MSSQL, and PostgreSQL. Key features of the project include:

- **Data Profiling and Cleansing**: Implemented using Alteryx to enhance data quality and integrity.
- **Error Handling and Load Statistics**: Managed through Talend to ensure accuracy and efficiency in data loading.
- **Performance Tuning**: Techniques applied to optimize the ETL process and maintain data integrity.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized PowerBI and Tableau to create interactive dashboards for deeper insights into sales trends and customer segmentation.
